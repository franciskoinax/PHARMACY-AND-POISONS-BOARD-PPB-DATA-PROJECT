Failure of assay identified during stability studies
"A defect on the injection port that may result in potentially critical clinical consequences for the patient e.g blood loss, underdosage or delay of therapy. Third party are at risk being inContact with patients fluids."
Sachets bloated and powder agglomerated
The assay of the active ingredient in the product may likely drop below the specifications of 95-105% based on stability data
Change in color
"Mislabeling. The secondary package is labelled as Flamodip-5 (Amlodipine), while the primary package is labelled as Flaminopril-5 (Enalapril)"
Mix-up between 0.5% w/v and 1% w/v strengths during the labeling and packing process
